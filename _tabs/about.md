Hi!

My name is Miguel. I'm from Colombia, and I got interested in cybersecurity after watching a video by S4vitar and Nate together. I used to think hacking was fake because I thought it only existed in movies and fiction. But after watching that video, I became interested in hacking and the world of cybersecurity. I started to look for ways to learn on my own. I enjoy self-learning, no matter the subject, because I believe any knowledge is valuable in life.

Right now (November 2024), I'm focused on learning English, which is why I haven’t published new content recently. For now, I’ll be posting in English about topics I enjoy or would like to discuss. This way, I can practice my English in a way that I find enjoyable (I’m writing from Linux in the terminal, and I love using Linux).

I currently consider my English level to be around B1.
